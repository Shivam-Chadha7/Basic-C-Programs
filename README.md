# Basic C Practice

This repository contains my early C programs as I learn the language.  
Right now, I'm working with:

- `printf` and `scanf`
- Basic algebra operations
- Reversing 3-digit numbers
- Summing the digits of a number (limited to fixed length for now)

## Programs Included

| File Name           | Description                                  |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `sum.c`             | Takes two numbers as input and prints their sum |
| `gross_salary.c`    | Calculates gross salary from basic salary    |
| `reverse_3digit.c`  | Reverses a 3-digit number like 456 â†’ 654     |
| `digit_sum_3digit.c`| Adds the digits of a 3-digit number like 456 â†’ 15 |

## Notes

These programs donâ€™t use loops yet â€” all logic is done using simple math operations.  
As I learn more (like loops and conditions), Iâ€™ll start adding more advanced programs here.

**Learning Progress:**  
âœ… Input/output  
âœ… Math with digits  
ðŸ•’ Loops and conditions â€” coming soon!

## How to Use

- Clone the repo or download files
- Compile the `.c` files using a C compiler like `gcc`
- Run them from terminal or any C IDE
